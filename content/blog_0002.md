After watching Sam H. Smith's talk at the Better Software Conference 2025, I
decided to attempt creating a compiler myself.

When you tell people nowadays that you want to create a new programming
language, most often they scoff at you and assume you have been living under a
rock for the past twenty years and haven't seen all of the "progress" in modern
languages.

But most modern languages suck.

In high-performance scenarios, people are still using C or C++ to create serious
software. Why? Because nothing we have created since 1970 can beat their ability
to allow programmers to program their computers directly. That's insane! So I
decided to "give it a whack" so-to-speak and see where we end up.

The language that I am compiling is a new language I designed. The syntax is
based off of a mixture between C and Pascal, but who cares about syntax. The
interesting stuff is in my plans for metaprogramming (hence the name...) but
that's foreshadowing.

If you want to learn more about sea of nodes, I suggest you check out the
repositories on GitHub. There are multiple implementations in different
languages, so you can follow along in whatever language you prefer. I will say
that some of the code was a bit tricky to figure out how to convert, since it's
mostly written in OOP.

(Oh yeah, and I don't use an AST either.)
