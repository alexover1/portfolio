# My Personal Portfolio Website

![logo](screenshot.png)

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website,
which you can find at [https://overgroup.me](https://overgroup.me).

I tried to make the website in the simplest way I could, not
utilizing any frameworks, libraries, or even JavaScript (minus
the [Pico-8](./pico8) games). As a result, the code should be
extremely simple to browse and learn how to make your own
website!
